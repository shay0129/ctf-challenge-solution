## Usage

### **PCAP Creation Overview**
![PCAP Screenshot](documents/pcap_screenshot.png)
**PCAP Creation for Participants:**
   - The PCAP file simulates communication between a server and two clients. Both clients perform a handshake with the server. The server requests a CLIENT CERT, but only Client 1 provides it, while Client 2 does not.
   - Encrypted application data communication occurs between Client 1 and the server, consisting of three packets (HTTP GET, 200 OK, resource sent).
The **UnifiedTLSSession** class facilitates the simulation of a TLS session between a client and a server, enabling the creation of PCAP files.

### **Core Features:**
1. **TLS Handshake**: Simulates certificate exchange and encryption negotiation to establish a secure connection.
2. **Application Data Exchange**: Supports both encrypted `TLS` and unencrypted `HTTP` communication based on session configuration.

```python
import logging

def main() -> None:
    """Main function to run TLS sessions"""
    # Load configuration first
    config = NetworkConfig.load()

    # Setup logging using the log_path and log_level from config
    setup_logging(
        log_path=config.log_path,
        level=config.log_level
    )
    logging.info("Starting TLS session simulation")

    # Setup environment and continue with rest of the code
    writer = setup_environment(config)
    
    # Run Client 1 session (with certificate)
    run_client_session(
        writer=writer,
        client_ip=NetworkAddresses.CLIENT_1_IP,
        server_ip=NetworkAddresses.SERVER_IP,
        client_port=NetworkPorts.CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        use_client_cert=True,
        request=NetworkConfig.GET_REQUEST,
        response=NetworkConfig.OK_RESPONSE,
        challenge_file=CHALLENGE_FILE
    )
    
    # Run Client 2 session (without certificate)
    run_client_session(
        writer=writer,
        client_ip=NetworkAddresses.CLIENT_2_IP,
        server_ip=NetworkAddresses.SERVER_IP,
        client_port=NetworkPorts.CLIENT_DEFAULT + 1,
        use_client_cert=False,
        request=NetworkConfig.GET_REQUEST,
        response=NetworkConfig.BAD_REQUEST
    )
    
    # Save and verify results
    save_results(writer, config)
```

### **TLS Handshake Steps**
The TLS handshake establishes a secure connection between the client and server by exchanging cryptographic parameters.

```python
import logging

def perform_handshake(self) -> bool:
    """Executes the TLS handshake steps"""
    send_client_hello(self)
    send_server_hello(self)
    send_client_handshake_messages(self)
    handle_master_secret(self)
    
    # The ChangeCipherSpec notifies the server that subsequent messages will be encrypted
    send_client_change_cipher_spec(self)
    send_server_change_cipher_spec(self)
    handle_ssl_key_log(self)
    
    self.state.handshake_completed = True
    logging.info("TLS Handshake completed successfully")
    return True
```

## **Client Hello**
**Purpose**: The client initiates the handshake by sending supported `ciphers`, `extensions`, and `random` bytes.

```python
from typing import Optional

def create_client_hello(
    session,
    extensions: Optional[ClientExtensions] = None
) -> TLSClientHello:
    """Creates a TLS Client Hello message"""
    # Generate client random
    session.client_GMT_unix_time, session.client_random_bytes = generate_random()
    session.client_random = session.client_GMT_unix_time.to_bytes(4, 'big') + session.client_random_bytes
    logging.info(f"Generated client_random: {session.client_random.hex()}")

    # Use default extensions if none provided
    if not extensions:
        extensions = ClientExtensions(
            server_name=session.SNI,
            supported_groups=["x25519"],
            signature_algorithms=["sha256+rsa"]
        )

    return TLSClientHello(
        version=TLSVersion.TLS_1_2,
        ciphers=[TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256],
        ext=extensions.get_extension_list(),
        gmt_unix_time=session.client_GMT_unix_time,
        random_bytes=session.client_random_bytes
    )
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **Client Random:** Combines the GMT Unix timestamp and 28 random bytes.
2. **Supported Ciphers:** Advertises the supported algorithms for encryption and hashing.
3. **Extensions:** Adds optional features like server name indication, supported groups, and signature algorithms.

---

## **Server Hello**
**Purpose**: Responds to the `Client Hello` by providing `random` bytes, the `selected cipher` (encryption parameters), and `extensions`.

```python
def create_server_hello(
        session,
        extensions: Optional[ServerExtensions] = None
        ) -> TLSServerHello:

    # Generate server random
    session.server_GMT_unix_time, session.server_random_bytes = generate_random()
    session.server_random = session.server_GMT_unix_time.to_bytes(4, 'big') + session.server_random_bytes
    logging.info(f"Generated server_random: {session.server_random.hex()}")

    # Use default extensions if none provided
    if not extensions:
        extensions = ServerExtensions(
            signature_algorithms=['sha256+rsaepss']
        )

    return TLSServerHello(
        version=TLSVersion.TLS_1_2,
        gmt_unix_time=session.server_GMT_unix_time,
        random_bytes=session.server_random_bytes,
        sid=os.urandom(32),
        cipher=TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256.val,
        ext=extensions.get_extension_list()
    )
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **Server Random:** Combines a timestamp and random bytes for key generation.
2. **Selected Cipher:** Agrees upon one cipher suite from the clientâ€™s list.
3. **Extensions:** Adds advanced security options like extended master secrets.

![Server certificate signed by CA](documents/signed_server_cert.png)

---

## **Client Key Exchange**
**Purpose**: The client generates a `Pre-Master Secret`, encrypts it, and sends it to the server.
This secret is encrypted using the server's `public key`, making it accessible only to the intended recipient.

```python
def create_client_certificate_and_key_exchange(
        session
        ) -> tuple[TLSCertificate, TLSClientKeyExchange]:

    # Prepare client certificate
    if session.use_client_cert:
        client_cert_path = CERTS_DIR / "client.crt"
        cert = load_cert(client_cert_path)
        cert_der = cert.public_bytes(serialization.Encoding.DER)
        client_certificate = TLSCertificate(certs=[(len(cert_der), cert_der)])
        logging.info("Prepared client certificate")
    else:
        client_certificate = TLSCertificate(certs=[])
        logging.info("Prepared empty certificate")

    # Generate and encrypt pre-master secret
    session.pre_master_secret = generate_pre_master_secret()
    session.encrypted_pre_master_secret = encrypt_pre_master_secret(
        session.pre_master_secret,
        session.server_public_key
    )

    if not isinstance(session.encrypted_pre_master_secret, bytes):
        session.encrypted_pre_master_secret = bytes(session.encrypted_pre_master_secret)
    
    logging.info(f"Encrypted pre_master_secret length: {len(session.encrypted_pre_master_secret)}")

    # Create key exchange message
    length_bytes = len(session.encrypted_pre_master_secret).to_bytes(2, 'big')
    client_key_exchange = TLSClientKeyExchange(
        exchkeys=length_bytes + session.encrypted_pre_master_secret
    )

    return client_certificate, client_key_exchange
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **Client Certificate:** A TLS certificate representing the client is prepared and appended to the handshake messages.
2. **Pre-Master Secret:** A randomly generated `pre-master secret` is created for the session.
   This value serves as the foundation for deriving the `master secret` used in subsequent encryption.
3. **Encryption:** The `pre-master secret` is encrypted using the `server's public key`, ensuring secure transmission.
   The encryption guarantees that only the server, possessing the corresponding `private key`, can decrypt it.
4. **Key Exchange Message:** The encrypted `pre-master secret` is packaged into a key exchange message, preceded by its length in bytes.

#### **Notice:**
In **TLS 1.2**, when using **RSA Key Exchange**, no `ServerKeyExchange` message is sent.
The handshake process relies on encrypting the `Pre-Master Secret` with the server's public key, so no additional signature is required from the server.
However, in cases of **Diffie-Hellman (DH)** or **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**, a `ServerKeyExchange` message is necessary.

---

## **Master Secret Generation**
```python
def generate_master_secret(
        session,
        encrypted_pre_master_secret: bytes,
        client_random: bytes,
        server_random: bytes
    ) -> bytes:

    # Decrypt pre-master secret
    pre_master_secret = decrypt_pre_master_secret(
        encrypted_pre_master_secret,
        session.server_private_key
    )
    
    logging.info(
        f"Decrypted pre_master_secret: {pre_master_secret.hex()}"
    )
    
    # Compute master secret
    master_secret = session.prf.compute_master_secret(
        pre_master_secret,
        client_random,
        server_random
    )
    
    logging.info(f"Generated master secret: {master_secret.hex()}")
    return master_secret
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **Decryption:** The server decrypts the `pre-master secret` using its private key.
2. **Master Secret Calculation:** Uses the PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) to derive the `master secret` from the `pre-master secret`, `client random`, and `server random` values.

### **Encryption Method:**
The `encrypt_pre_master_secret()` function:
- Uses **PKCS#1 v1.5 padding** (standard for RSA encryption).
- Encrypts the `pre-master secret` with the **server's public key**.
- Returns the encrypted bytes.

---

#### Calculate Master Secret
**Purpose:** The `master secret` is a crucial part of the TLS handshake, derived by both the client and server using the `pre-master secret` and `random` values exchanged during the handshake. It ensures the secure generation of session keys for encryption and integrity checks.

```python
def handle_master_secret(session) -> None:
    session.master_secret = generate_master_secret(
        session,
        session.encrypted_pre_master_secret,
        session.client_random,
        session.server_random
    )
```

***Explanation:***
1. **Client Side:**
   - The client encrypts the `pre_master_secret` using the server's public key from its certificate.
   - This ensures that only the server can decrypt it.

2. **Server Side:**
   - The server decrypts the `pre_master_secret` using its private key.
   - This step verifies that the client has a valid server certificate and ensures confidentiality.

3. **Both Sides:**
   - Using the same `pre_master_secret`, along with the `client_random` and `server_random`, both the client and server derive the same `master_secret`.
   - This `master_secret` is the foundation for symmetric encryption keys used in the session.

---

#### Client Change Cipher Spec

**Purpose:** The `ChangeCipherSpec` message is sent by the client to notify the server that it will start using the negotiated encryption and MAC settings. This is immediately followed by the `Finished` message, encrypted with the newly established settings.

```python
def send_client_change_cipher_spec(session) -> bytes:
    # Create messages
    client_finished, change_cipher_spec = create_client_finished(session)

    # Send messages
    session.send_to_server(client_finished)
    session.send_to_server(change_cipher_spec)

    # Update handshake state
    session.handshake_messages.append(raw(client_finished))
    session.handshake_messages.append(raw(change_cipher_spec))
    session.tls_context.msg = [change_cipher_spec, client_finished]

    logging.info("Client ChangeCipherSpec and Finished messages sent")
    return session.send_tls_packet(
        session.client_ip,
        session.server_ip,
        session.client_port,
        session.server_port,
        is_handshake=True
    )
```

***Explanation:***
1. **Verify Data:**
   - The client computes the `verify_data` using all previous handshake messages and the derived `master_secret`.
   - This ensures the integrity of the handshake.

2. **ChangeCipherSpec Message:**
   - Signals the server that future messages will use the negotiated encryption and integrity settings.

3. **Finished Message:**
   - This is the first message encrypted with the new cipher settings, proving that both client and server share the same session keys.

---

#### Server Change Cipher Spec

**Purpose:** The server sends the `ChangeCipherSpec` message to notify the client it will use the negotiated encryption settings. It follows with the `Finished` message, encrypted with the new settings, to confirm the handshake.

```python
def send_server_change_cipher_spec(session) -> bytes:
    # Create messages
    server_finished, change_cipher_spec = create_server_finished(session)

    # Send messages
    session.send_to_client(server_finished)
    session.send_to_client(change_cipher_spec)

    # Update handshake state
    session.handshake_messages.append(raw(server_finished))
    session.handshake_messages.append(raw(change_cipher_spec))
    session.tls_context.msg = [change_cipher_spec, server_finished]

    logging.info("Server ChangeCipherSpec and Finished messages sent")
    return session.send_tls_packet(
        session.server_ip,
        session.client_ip,
        session.server_port,
        session.client_port,
        is_handshake=True
    )
```

***Explanation:***
1. **Verify Data:**
   - The server computes `verify_data` using the handshake messages and `master_secret`.
   - Confirms the integrity and authenticity of the handshake.

2. **ChangeCipherSpec Message:**
   - Notifies the client that the server is switching to the negotiated encryption settings.

3. **Finished Message:**
   - Sent encrypted, verifying that the server is ready for secure communication.

---

#### **Create SSLKeyLog File**

**Purpose:** Enables debugging of encrypted TLS traffic by exporting the `master_secret` and `client_random` to a log file, making it compatible with tools like Wireshark.

```python
def setup_environment(config: NetworkConfig) -> CustomPcapWriter:
    writer = CustomPcapWriter(config)
    
    # Clear SSL keylog file
    if hasattr(config, 'SSL_KEYLOG_FILE'):
        Path(LoggingPaths.SSL_KEYLOG).write_text('')
        logging.info(f"Cleared SSL keylog file: {LoggingPaths.SSL_KEYLOG}")
    
    return writer

def handle_ssl_key_log(session) -> None:
    # Make sure directory exists
    LoggingPaths.SSL_KEYLOG.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Open in write mode to clear previous content
    with open(LoggingPaths.SSL_KEYLOG, "w") as f:
        client_random_hex = session.client_random.hex()
        master_secret_hex = session.master_secret.hex()
        # Format: CLIENT_RANDOM <client_random_hex> <master_secret_hex>
        f.write(f"CLIENT_RANDOM {client_random_hex} {master_secret_hex}\n")
```

***Explanation:***
1. **Clearing the SSL Key Log File:**
   - The log file is cleared at the start to ensure no residual data from previous sessions interferes with debugging.

2. **Writing Keys:**
   - The `client_random` and `master_secret` are logged in the format:
     ```
     CLIENT_RANDOM <client_random> <master_secret>
     ```
   - This allows Wireshark to decrypt the captured traffic by reconstructing session keys.

3. **Integration with Wireshark:**
   - The generated log file can be loaded into Wireshark via the *SSL protocol settings* to enable real-time decryption of the TLS packets.

#### Application Data Encryption
Code for encrypting application data using AES-128-CBC with HMAC-SHA256.

```python
def _handle_encrypted_exchange(
        self,
        request_data: bytes,
        response_data: bytes,
        file_to_send: Optional[str]
    ) -> None:
        """Handle encrypted data exchange"""
        try:
            # Send client request
            logging.info("Sending encrypted request data")
            encrypt_and_send_application_data(
                self, request_data, is_request=True,
                prf=self.prf, master_secret=self.master_secret,

                tls_context=self.tls_context, state=self.state
            )
            
            # Send server response
            logging.info("Sending encrypted response data")
            encrypt_and_send_application_data(
                self, response_data, is_request=False,
                prf=self.prf, master_secret=self.master_secret,
                server_random=self.server_random, client_random=self.client_random,
                client_ip=self.client_ip, server_ip=self.server_ip,
                client_port=self.client_port, server_port=self.server_port,
                tls_context=self.tls_context, state=self.state
            )
            
            # Send file if available
            if file_to_send:
                logging.info(f"Attempting to send file: {file_to_send}")
                self._send_file(file_to_send)
                logging.info("File sent successfully")
```

### SSL Communication Overview


**Two Communication Sessions:**
   - **Session 1: Server and Client Communication:**
     - The server is an Iranian server, and participants need to understand from the PCAP that the server expects the client to send a client certificate signed by a specific CA.
     - Participants then move to the next communication session.

   - **Session 2: Client and CA Server Communication:**
     - The client requests the CA server to sign a CSR.
     - The CA server signs the CSR and sends back a signed certificate.
     - Participants return to the first communication session and attempt to send the signed CLIENT CERT to the Iranian server but find that the server does not respond positively.
     - The server requires a specific condition to be present in the certificate.
     - Participants realize they need to edit the CSR before sending it to the CA.
     - By performing a MITM attack using Burp Suite, participants edit the CSR as required and get it signed by the CA.
     - Participants return to the first communication session and send the appropriate CRT to the Iranian server.
     - The server responds positively and sends encrypted messages to the client.
     - Participants need to determine the encryption cipher used.

3. **Decrypting the Encrypted Messages:**
   - The server downloads an image to the participant's computer, showing an Enigma machine and a hidden hint in the binary code of the image (hex view) that contains the Enigma machine configuration, except for the specific model.
   - Using the configuration and searching online for Enigma cipher decryption, participants can determine the machine model.
   - After decryption, participants understand the words "Client" and "Master Secret" and need to deduce that these are two strings forming the SSLKEYLOG file.
   - They load it into Wireshark, decrypt the application data, and find the flag.

---

## Participants Solution

In this section of the README, I would describe possible solutions to the challenge, focusing on the ways participants might approach and solve the problem. Here is a possible wording:

**Possible Solutions:**

* **Identifying MITM Weakness:** Experienced participants will identify the potential for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the communication between the client and the Certificate Authority. They will understand that forging the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) will allow them to obtain a digital certificate with the correct domain name, thereby bypassing the server's check.
* **Using Burp Suite:** Participants can use Burp Suite or another proxy tool to intercept and modify the network traffic between `csr_client.exe` and `ca_server.exe`.
* **Forging the Domain Name:** Participants will need to identify the domain name expected by the server and modify the CSR accordingly.
* **Decrypting the Enigma Cipher:** After successfully connecting to the server, participants will need to analyze the image file and server messages to understand that they are dealing with an Enigma cipher. They can use online tools or write scripts to decrypt the cipher.
* **Extracting Information from Enigma Messages:** Participants will need to identify and use critical information from the decrypted Enigma messages, such as the `client random` and `master secret`, to decrypt the TLS traffic.
* **Decrypting TLS Traffic:** Participants can use Wireshark or another tool to decrypt the network traffic, using the information extracted from the Enigma messages.
* **Finding the Flag:** Finally, participants will need to analyze the decrypted traffic to find the flag.

**Possible Variations:**

* There may be multiple ways to forge the CSR.
* There may be additional hints or hidden challenges within the image file or Enigma messages.
* A deeper analysis of the TLS protocol or Enigma cipher may be required.

It is important to note that this is just a general description of possible solutions. Participants may find creative and unique ways to solve the challenge.

# TLS Project

## Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```
Usage:
```bash
python -m tls.main
```

3. Now the instructor can:
- Download the code from Git
- Run `pip install -e .`
- Then run `python -m tls.main`

This is the standard way to organize Python projects, and it will work consistently in any environment.

Would you like me to help you add the required dependencies to setup.py?
